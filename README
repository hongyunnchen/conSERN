# conSERN

conSERN contains code for fast-generation of Spatially Embedded Random
Networks, such as the Waxman random graph.

### Contents
The directories are
    conSERN:   C source code
    Matlab:    examples, and tests using Matlab through a Mex file


### Installation

(1)
   Mac OSX installation is via Xcode.

   Linux
     Enter the conSERN directory, and type
         make
     This should construct the libraries, and a Matlab Mex file (for
     linux). Some modifications to the makefile might be needed for
     local customisation. 

(2) The "testgen.m" matlab script in Matlab should now work.

(3) If you want to get all of the tests reported in [1] then you also
    need to install the "Linepicking" package from
        https://github.com/mroughan/LinePicking
    and set the appropriate paths in linepicking.m
 
(4) If you want to run this from another directory, then you will have
    to set up an appropriate search path.
