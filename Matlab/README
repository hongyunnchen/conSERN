# FastSERN tools

## Contents

   Test files
      testgen.m        - initial test its working
      examples.m       - examples using some of the features
      FastSERN_testX.m - tests used to benchmark the code
	FastSERN_test1.m  -- comparison of methods vs n and M (large s)
	FastSERN_test1a.m -- comparison of methods vs n and M (small s)
	FastSERN_test2.m  -- comparison of affect of M for varying s 
	FastSERN_test3.m  -- look at multi-threading performance
	FastSERN_test4.m  -- big case

   Useful files
      common.m      -- common definitions and colour etc for output
      defaults.m    -- parameter defaults and path setup
      linepicking.m -- links to linepicking code used in benchmarks
      FastSERN.m    -- sets up help for Matlab

   Others (which are what they sound like)
      laplace_trans.m
      laplace_trans_test.m
      waxman_gen.m


## Dependencies: 
 
   Benchmarks depend on LinePicking code, but only  to calculate q
           (q is calculated to give fixed average node degree k)
 

## Installation:
       See top level README
